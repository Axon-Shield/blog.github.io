# Blog Post Images Organization

This directory contains images organized by blog post for better maintainability.

## Structure

- Include post slug in directory name for organization
- Use web-optimized formats: JPG for photos, PNG for diagrams/screenshots
- Keep file sizes reasonable for web loading
