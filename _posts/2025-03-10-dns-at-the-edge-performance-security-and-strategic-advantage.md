*Dns Edge Computing*

As applications move closer to users through edge computing
  - DNS infrastructure must evolve to match. Edge DNS isn't just about faster resolutionâ€”it's about creating intelligent
  - security-aware infrastructure that provides strategic business advantages through superior performance and enhanced security capabilities.

## The Edge Computing Revolution

### What is Edge Computing?
Edge computing brings computation and data storage closer to users by:
- **Geographic distribution**: Servers deployed globally
  - near users
- **Reduced latency**: Minimizing distance between users and computing resources
- **Improved performance**: Faster response times for applications and content
- **Enhanced reliability**: Reducing dependence on centralized infrastructure
- **Better user experience**: Responsive applications regardless of location

### Why DNS Must Move to the Edge
Traditional centralized DNS creates bottlenecks in edge architectures:
- **Latency introduction**: Central DNS servers adding unnecessary delays
- **Single points of failure**: Centralized DNS affecting global applications
- **Suboptimal routing**: Users directed to distant servers despite local availability
- **Performance degradation**: DNS lookups becoming the slowest part of connections
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Centralized targets for attacks
