*Dns Edge Computing*

As applications move closer to users through edge computing
  - DNS infrastructure must evolve to match. Edge DNS isn't just about faster resolution—it's about creating intelligent
  - security-aware infrastructure that provides strategic business advantages through superior performance and enhanced security capabilities.

## The Edge Computing Revolution

### What is Edge Computing?
Edge computing brings computation and data storage closer to users by:
