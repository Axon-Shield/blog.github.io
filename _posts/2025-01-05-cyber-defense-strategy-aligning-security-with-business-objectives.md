*Cyber Defense - before you start building a change programme*

When communicating with a board or cross-functional teams, a strategy needs to be clear, concise, and aligned with broader business objectives. The focus is to a large degree driven by personal beliefs and priorities of you as a responsible executive. Once you align your priorities with stakeholders, you can start building a change programme down to your cyber defense operations.

When communicating with a board or cross-functional teams, a strategy needs to be clear, concise, and aligned with broader business objectives. The focus is to a large degree driven by personal beliefs and priorities of you as a responsible executive. Once you align your priorities with stakeholders, you can start building a change programme down to your cyber defense operations.

A cyber defense strategy is a structured approach that translates technical security capabilities into business value and risk management. It should address three key questions:

1.  Where are we now?

2.  Where do we want to be?

3.  How will we get there?

Answers to the first question don't change too much and would only slowly evolve as a result of short-term projects and changes in the cyber defense functions.

The same holds for the second question unless there is a business-changing event that causes the company to rethink its priorities. This can result from internal pressures or the arrival of a new cybersecurity executive, you taking on a new challenge. You have mapped out your new position, team, and efforts, and you are ready to define a new approach to make a positive impact on the company’s capabilities.

If you're allowed to change the methodology to measure your new team's cyber defense capabilities, you are likely to come up with a new list of priorities for "Where do we want to be".

The answers to this question should be structured and tangible. Whilst cyber defense is primarily internal "affair", companies are able to align it with business objectives and even make it part of their competitive positioning.

Some aspects of cyber defense would impact all your technology teams and ability to communicate your priorities and intended initiatives early on should be our first step. If technology projects are outsourced, cyber defense may become the only "gate" where your company enforces its "technology" policies.

In our experience, pro-active communication of your intended changes have a massively positive impact on how you will deliver on your intentions. Establishing technology forums where IT teams can raise concerns, feedback on your technology changes and discuss challenges connects you with non-cyber teams and create necessary momentum.

With application and platform teams understanding intended security changes, you can create realistic assessments of:

*   Business impact, not just technical details - integrating related changes into IT roadmaps limits negative impact and additional costs.

*   Clear ROI and risk reduction - ROI may be limited to your budget but if your plans include transparent protections that can be delivered centrally, you may be able to have positive impact on the cost and timelines of other projects with direct impact on your company's business.

*   Actionable insights for decision-makers - many managers tend to push "policies" down to engineers without fully understanding daily challenges faced by teams actually delivering revenue-generating applications. Getting engineers to comment on your plans early makes your ability to execute required changes realistic.

Cyber Strategy Objectives
-------------------------

Let's have a look at how you can start phrasing your strategic goals. Based on industry observations, some of the most common combinations of cyber strategy objectives include the following (along with a list of the most common environments and company types):

1.  Risk reduction and compliance— as you would expect, these goals are most relevant to sectors with external regulation.
    *   Banks and financial services
    *   Healthcare providers and insurers
    *   Government contractors
    *   Critical infrastructure operators
    *   Large public companies common thread: heavy regulation and high-value assets to protect
2.  Resiliency and technology enhancement—these goals are relevant to technology-heavy, innovative, and lean (in terms of operational costs) companies.
    *   Software companies
    *   Cloud service providers
    *   E-commerce platforms
    *   Digital service providers
    *   Tech startups Common thread: technology is core to business model
3.  Maturity Progression with Cultural Transformation - You are likely to prioritize these aspects in established companies that have outgrown security models and protections built to already scaled-up operations over 10 years ago, often using on-premises technologies.
    *   Traditional companies undergoing digital transformation
    *   Manufacturing moving to Industry 4.0
    *   Retail chains expanding to omnichannel
    *   Professional service firms digitalizing operations
    *   Common thread: transitioning from legacy to digital operations
4.  Compliance and Cultural Awareness - Cultural awareness is prioritized in organizations with a high proportion of non-technical or "customer-facing" employees.
    *   Professional service firms (law, consulting)
    *   Educational institutions
    *   Non-profit organizations
    *   Local government agencies common thread: Large workforce handling sensitive data
5.  Risk Reduction and Innovation Positioning - the final combination we mention here is most relevant to highly innovative companies, with security being a significant part of their business proposition.
    *   B2B technology vendors
    *   Payment processors
    *   Identity management providers
    *   Data analytics companies
    *   Security service providers common thread: Security capability is part of value proposition

As you can see, the most effective strategies typically blend 2-3 of basic objectives, creating a nuanced approach that goes beyond a one-dimensional security perspective. The selection of relevant strategy objectives needs to be agreed on the board level / with technology and business C-executives. If the company is subject to external regulation, cyber defense has to also work closely with internal legal teams and agree a long-term compliance model.
