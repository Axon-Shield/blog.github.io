Traditional Web Application Firewalls were designed for monolithic applications with predictable traffic patterns and centralized architectures. Modern microservices and serverless architectures present fundamentally different challenges that require evolved WAF strategies focused on precision, context awareness, and distributed security controls.

## The Modern Architecture Challenge

### Microservices Complexity
Modern applications consist of dozens or hundreds of microservices:
- **Distributed communication**: East-west traffic between services
- **Dynamic scaling**: Services scaling independently based on demand
- **Polyglot architectures**: Different technologies and frameworks per service
- **API-first design**: REST, GraphQL, and gRPC APIs predominating
- **Container orchestration**: Kubernetes and similar platforms managing services

### Serverless Characteristics
- **Event-driven execution**: Functions triggered by events and API calls
- **Ephemeral nature**: Functions existing only during execution
- **Cold start behaviors**: Initial execution delays affecting patterns
- **Auto-scaling**: Instant scaling from zero to thousands of instances
- **Stateless design**: No persistent connections or session state

### Traditional WAF Limitations
#### Monolithic Assumptions
- **Perimeter-based protection**: Assuming clear network boundaries
- **Static rule sets**: Rules designed for predictable application behavior
- **Session awareness**: Relying on persistent connections and sessions
- **Single application context**: Not designed for multi-service architectures
- **Manual configuration**: Requiring extensive manual tuning per application

#### Context Blindness
- **Service relationships**: No understanding of service-to-service communication
- **Business logic awareness**: Missing context about legitimate service interactions
- **User journey mapping**: Inability to track users across multiple services
- **Service dependencies**: No knowledge of service interaction patterns
- **API semantics**: Lack of understanding of API-specific behaviors

## Accuracy Challenges in Modern Architectures

### False Positive Scenarios
#### Inter-Service Communication
- **Legitimate automation**: Service-to-service calls flagged as bot traffic
- **Bulk operations**: Batch processing mistaken for attacks
- **Health checks**: Monitoring requests triggering rate limiting
- **Circuit breaker patterns**: Retry mechanisms causing false alarms
- **Load balancer probes**: Infrastructure checks seen as suspicious

#### API-Specific Patterns
- **GraphQL queries**: Complex queries mistaken for injection attacks
- **JSON payloads**: Legitimate data structures flagged as malicious
- **Base64 encoding**: Encoded data triggering content filters
- **Webhook callbacks**: External systems triggering security rules
- **File uploads**: Legitimate file content causing blocks

### False Negative Risks
#### Distributed Attack Vectors
- **Low and slow attacks**: Attacks distributed across many services
- **Logic flaws**: Attacks exploiting business logic across services
- **Data exfiltration**: Information gathering across multiple APIs
- **Privilege escalation**: Attacks moving between service boundaries
- **Supply chain attacks**: Compromised dependencies affecting multiple services
