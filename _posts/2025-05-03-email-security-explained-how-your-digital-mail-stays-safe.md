*Email Security*

These are a few of the tools that bond together to shield your email:

- The SPF & DKIM combination serves as a check for the real sender of the email
- DMARC in its turn warns about not secured mails that are looking suspicious
- The message is wrapped in a tunnel and only the address and email can go through (TLS)
- Furthermore
  - the path map is checked by DANE and therefore you are ensured that you drive to the correct location

## Email Security Analogy

It's kinda like having a letter with:

- **A well-known and trusted return address (SPF)**: Verifies the sender's identity
- **An official digital signature (DKIM)**: Confirms message authenticity
- **Practical guidelines for handling suspect mail (DMARC)**: Provides policy enforcement
- **The email is like a private and secure delivery truck (TLS)**: Encrypts the transport
- **A dependable and checked map to the right place (DANE)**: Validates the destination

## Email Security Protocols Explained

### SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
SPF allows domain owners to specify which mail servers are authorized to send emails on behalf of their domain. This helps prevent email spoofing by verifying that incoming mail from a domain comes from a host authorized by that domain's administrators.

### DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
DKIM provides a digital signature that validates the authenticity of the email content. It ensures that the message hasn't been tampered with during transit and confirms the sender's identity.

### DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication
  - Reporting & Conformance)
DMARC builds on SPF and DKIM by adding a policy layer that tells receiving mail servers what to do with messages that fail authentication checks. It also provides reporting capabilities for domain owners.

### TLS (Transport Layer Security)
TLS encrypts the connection between mail servers
  - ensuring that email content cannot be intercepted or read by unauthorized parties during transmission.

### DANE (DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities)
DANE uses DNS to specify which certificates are valid for a particular service
  - adding an extra layer of security by preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Why Should You Care?

Email security might sound boring
  - but it's super important! Without these tools
  - bad people could:

- **Pretend to be your school or friends**: Email spoofing attacks
- **Read private messages**: Interception of sensitive communications
- **Send fake emails that look real**: Phishing attacks
- **Steal passwords and personal information**: Credential harvesting

## The Invisible Helpers
