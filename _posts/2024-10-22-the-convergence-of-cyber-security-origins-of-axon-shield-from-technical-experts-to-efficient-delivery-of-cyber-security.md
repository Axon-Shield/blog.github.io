*Convergence Cyber Security*

We have seen strongly regulated environments as well as infrastructures with hundreds of thousands of domains with websites and APIs. We have recently realised that we had been repeating similar things over and over again - avoiding previous mistakes, speeding up built of toolkits and establishing operating models. To put it simply, if you want to make your internet presence dependable, there are a handful of changes you need to implement first. When implemented correctly, they have dramatic impact on your resiliency and incidents related to external attacks.


Diverse Beginnings: Our Technical Foundations
---------------------------------------------

Dan and Charlie’s journey into the realm of cybersecurity is deeply rooted in their distinct yet complementary technical backgrounds. Their diverse experiences have significantly shaped their approach as consultants, blending theoretical knowledge and practical expertise in their careers in cybersecurity.

Dan, with his background as a researcher at Cambridge University and a professor in the Czech Republic, has begun using his academic experience to transform how clients manage their cybersecurity as a Deloitte consultant. His academic rigor has equipped him with a profound understanding of cryptographic protocols, secure communication, and information integrity. This solid foundation has enabled him not only to design technical frameworks essential for building new secure systems but also to identify potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited in real-world applications—often by simply reviewing high-level designs. Dan’s expertise in key management particularly stands out, providing him with specialized insight into the lifecycle of cryptographic keys and their importance in safeguarding sensitive information.

On the other hand, Charlie’s background as a penetration tester and threat hunter offers a starkly different perspective. Having directly engaged with network systems and the security of operating systems, he possesses hands-on experience in identifying, exploiting, and mitigating vulnerabilities across varied environments. His role as a penetration tester has allowed him to simulate cyberattacks, providing invaluable insights into the potential impact of new vulnerabilities on clients’ infrastructure. Furthermore, his passion for threat hunting has honed his skills in proactively searching for malicious activities within a network, allowing him to grasp the evolving nature of cyber threats. Charlie’s practical skills and real-world experiences enable him to tackle the challenges faced by organizations today, making him a vital asset in the cybersecurity landscape.

Together, Dan and Charlie’s diverse technical foundations—academic precision and hands-on experience—create a robust synergy, facilitating their successful collaboration in the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity.

The Shift - from Technology to People
-------------------------------------

The transition of Dan and Charlie from seasoned technical experts to cybersecurity consultants reflects their acute awareness of the evolving landscape of cyber threats. With an ever-increasing reliance on digital infrastructure, organizations face a barrage of sophisticated attacks that require not just technical knowledge but also strategic thinking. They recognized that this change was not simply a career move; it was a response to the pressing need to understand the technical roots of attacks as well as how to respond to these threats.

Emerging threats such as ransomware attacks, phishing schemes, massive DDoS attacks, and advanced persistent threats necessitate a comprehensive approach that depends on the visibility of events across the IT infrastructure. The ability to collect, combine, and analyze this data is paramount for effective defense. This process combines technical know-how with the ability to assess risks, develop preventive strategies, and implement robust cybersecurity frameworks. This growing complexity demands teams with diverse skill sets, teams that take years to build and require a substantial budget to maintain.

Dan and Charlie’s technical backgrounds afford them a unique perspective that enables them to build a methodology to establish this groundwork quickly and efficiently so that clients gain visibility of threats and can focus on processing those findings to mitigate them. Their blend of skills empowers them to provide insights that go beyond conventional security measures to include the strategic alignment of cybersecurity with business objectives. AXON Shield is not a typical consultancy; it delivers targeted information, helps sharpen operational procedures, and provides managers with measurable information to understand changes to the threat profiles and their ability to respond to attacks.

Our journey highlights a crucial evolution in cybersecurity practices—transitioning from a reactive stance to a proactive partnership aimed at delivering comprehensive strategies that anticipate and mitigate potential threats. By founding AXON Shield, Dan and Charlie demonstrate the evolution of the industry, where the strategic advisory role extends into the daily operations and practical support of IT and cybersecurity managers.

Lessons Learned: Insights from the Field
----------------------------------------

Throughout their careers in cybersecurity consulting, Charlie and Dan have gained invaluable insights that highlight the complexities and challenges of the field. One of the most significant lessons they have learned is the necessity of adaptability. Cyber threats are dynamic, evolving rapidly to exploit vulnerabilities in systems and processes. This means that information gathering must adapt quickly so that operational teams always have relevant information at hand. Well-structured, accurate, and specific information is paramount for efficient and effective cybersecurity operations.

Working with a diverse array of clients has further underscored the importance of tailoring the output from existing SaaS systems and infrastructure monitoring to specific organizational needs. Each client presents unique challenges, and understanding their operations, culture, and risk tolerance is key to developing effective operational processes. Dan and Charlie emphasize the need for deep engagement with clients, focusing more on the operational level than on technology. Their experience shows that only when available tools and services are mastered and efficiently integrated into internal teams can managers, their teams, and their organizations truly maximize the value from investments in those tools.

AXON Shield combines two aspects of Charlie's and Dan's professional lives: building technology to deliver data and analyzing, understanding, and extrapolating customers' data to suggest longer-term strategy and planning.
