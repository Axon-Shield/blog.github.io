- **Resource intensity**: Requires significant resources in short timeframe

### Phased Migration
#### Advantages
- **Reduced risk**: Lower impact if individual phases fail
- **Incremental validation**: Opportunity to test and validate each phase
- **Flexible timeline**: Ability to adjust schedule based on results
- **Learning opportunities**: Apply lessons learned to subsequent phases
- **Easier rollback**: Simpler to revert individual components

#### Disadvantages
- **Extended timeline**: Longer overall migration duration
- **Increased complexity**: Managing multiple systems simultaneously
- **Resource distribution**: Extended resource commitment over time
- **Integration challenges**: Maintaining compatibility between systems
- **Delayed benefits**: Slower realization of new platform advantages

### Hybrid Approach
#### Parallel Operation
- **Dual secrets management**: Running both Vault and new platform simultaneously
- **Selective migration**: Moving specific applications or secrets gradually
- **Risk mitigation**: Maintaining Vault as backup during transition
- **Gradual transition**: Slowly shifting workloads to new platform
- **Extended validation**: Long-term testing of new platform capabilities
