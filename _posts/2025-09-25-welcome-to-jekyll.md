Welcome to the Shield Guard security blog! This site is built with Jekyll and the Minimal Mistakes theme, optimized for sharing security insights and content.

This post will be available at: `https://blog.axonshield.com/welcome-to-jekyll/`

To add new security-focused posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md` and includes the necessary front matter.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
