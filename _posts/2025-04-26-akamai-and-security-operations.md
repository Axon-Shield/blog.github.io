This blog post details experiences implementing Akamai security services across two large organizations, transforming limited initial deployments into comprehensive security solutions.

We have been using Akamai extensively to provide perimeter security protection and resilience against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, as well as application-level attacks with its web application firewall (WAF) capabilities. 

## Implementation Challenges

Through our experience deploying Akamai across enterprise environments, we've identified several key challenges that organizations face:

### Operational Response
- Managing security alerts at scale
- Coordinating response teams across different time zones
- Balancing security posture with business continuity

### DoS Protection
- Fine-tuning detection thresholds
- Managing false positives
- Ensuring legitimate traffic flow

## Key Learnings

Our deployment experience across multiple large organizations has revealed important insights:

- **Gradual rollout approach**: Start with non-critical services before protecting mission-critical applications
- **Team coordination**: Establish clear communication channels between security, operations, and development teams
- **Monitoring strategy**: Implement comprehensive logging and alerting from day one
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed operational procedures and incident response playbooks

## Best Practices

Based on our implementations, we recommend:

1. **Establish baseline metrics** before deployment
2. **Create detailed migration plans** with rollback procedures
3. **Train operational teams** on Akamai's management interfaces
4. **Implement proper monitoring** and alerting mechanisms
5. **Regular security reviews** and configuration updates
