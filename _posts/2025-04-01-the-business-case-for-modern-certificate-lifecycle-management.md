*Certificate Lifecycle is not alchemy*

Certificate management is still a synonym for obscure technologies requiring skills with zero value outside very niche use cases. With the progress and spread of automation for certificate management, our focus must turn from PKI specialists to engineers and administrators that would automate certificates just like they do any number of server/application management.

As an organization’s digital presence grows larger it must actively manage its digital certificates because it is fundamental to its security architecture. As companies expand their online presence the difficulty of managing SSL/TLS certificates becomes substantially more complicated and depending on traditional PKI designs leads to high operational costs. This article looks at how Axon Shield’s technology provides a contemporary approach to Certificate Lifecycle Management, enabling users to effectively manage certificates with the help of experienced IT administrators rather than PKI specialists who are scarce.

Modern Serverless Architecture
------------------------------

Axon Shield implements a unique approach to manage Certificates throughout their Lifecycle by utilizing fully-managed PKI cloud services together with a completely serverless infrastructure-as-code setup that provides enterprise integration APIs. The traditional solutions demand additional software installations and continuous maintenance which distinguishes them from our approach.

*   Core PKI (certificate issuance) uses platform-managed services which can be simply replaced by any technology that offers "digital signing."

*   The deployment is fully managed through infrastructure-as-code.

*   AWS managed services such as RDS and AWS Private Certificate Authority serve as the primary CA in the solution implementation.

*   The solution operates from a dedicated VPC which provides a complete network isolation and meets strict security standards. The customer organization can own the separate cloud account where Axon deploys the entire solution.

*   No further custom software installation or maintenance is required because end-user clients can access our solution which enables monitoring of client status via regular version checks.

*   The integration with existing cloud infrastructure is seamless.

*   The system operates on dependable and expandable AWS managed services.

*   AWS Private CA integration enables the system to meet FIPS 140-2 Level 3 requirements for key security.

*   Network and logical separation enables the solution to support HIPAA, PCI, and other regulatory standards.

The use of a serverless architecture provides maximum reliability along with scalable and cost-effective solutions which decrease operational overhead and ensure top security standards.

Challenge of Certificates - Validity Shortening
-----------------------------------------------

The challenge for organizations is that they operate multiple digital certificates across their infrastructure which they must monitor and securely distribute alongside timely renewals. When certificates are handled manually for these needs, the consequences are:

*   Unforeseen certificate expirations leading to service interruptions
*   Outdated certificates which pose security risks
*   Substantially high operational costs in managing certificates manually
*   Non-compliance risks arising from incorrect certificate handling procedures.
*   Lack of visibility into certificate usage and status

Transforming Certificate Management
-----------------------------------

Axon Shield technology-enabled modern CLM solutions solve these problems through automation as well as centralized management. The key components of this approach include:

### Automated Certificate Provisioning through ACME

ACME protocol enables certificate creation and renewal with enhanced efficiency through automated processes. Axon Shield's ACME interface enables:

*   Reducing the likelihood of service disruptions because expired certificates require manual replacement but automated requests and renewals eliminate this need thus ensuring constant service availability.

*   The practice of certificate generation via manual processes is eliminated by standardized, automated workflows which cover all aspects of certificate issuance from key generation to installation and validation.

*   Certificate management errors decrease because automated procedures replace faulty manual processes maintaining adherence to security policies and best practices.

*   Through automated provisioning services are deployed more rapidly thus enabling the necessary certificates for new services to scale with business demands without security delays.

*   The uniform application of certificate policies throughout the organization, enforced by central management and automated policy application, ensures all certificates meet security and organizational standards.

*   A certificate renewal process includes integrated automated revocation management.

*   Certificate inventory management automates the administration of certificates to give real-time insights into all environmental certificates and their current status along with their upcoming renewal dates.

### Centralized ACME Client Management

The ability to distribute and manage ACME clients across the infrastructure from a centrally managed repository gives several advantages:

*   Version management - Simplifying problem analysis and corrections

*   Centralized management of clients via a repository, whether on-premises, in the cloud, or in hybrid setups, for streamlined certificate deployment across various environments.

*   The ability to enforce uniform security policies across all endpoints is achieved by centrally managing distributed clients, thus ensuring consistent certificate standards and security practices.

*   The distributed clients reduce the operational burden for IT teams by independently managing local certificate tasks with centralized visibility and control through the management platform.

*   A single management interface provides enhanced certificate visibility and control along with real-time status updates and health metrics from all distributed ACME clients throughout the infrastructure.

*   Automated monitoring of client health that continuously assesses the status and performance of distributed ACME clients, and notifies administrators of any issues that may affect certificate management.

*   The deployment of distributed clients provides inherent redundancy and high availability, which removes single points of failure in the certificate management process.

### Centralized Truststore Management

It is important to manage the ‘trusted’ certificate authorities no less than it is important to issue the certificates for the long-term management of internal or enterprise certificates. Using certificate authorities not approved by the organization can put the data in transit at risk and the lack of ability to add new certificate authorities can limit your organization’s ability to automate certificate issuance. Organisations can:

*   Help application teams run straightforward operational procedures to manage applications

*   Keep all systems in sync with regard to trust relationships

*   Update trust anchors across the infrastructure quickly

*   Help prevent risk from using outdated or compromised certificates

*   Supports compliance with security policies to the highest degree

*   Enable rapid response to security threats.

### Enhanced Certificate Validation and Analytics

Through serving CRL and OCSP requests proxies provide valuable information about certificate use and aid in building dependency graphs to study connections to servers that have new certificates. These extensive monitoring features deliver both operational and security advantages.

*   Through the analysis of CRL and OCSP request patterns, advanced security monitoring can detect certificate compromises early by looking for unusual validation request behaviours or sudden changes in access patterns.

*   Real time monitoring of the certificate validation status gives you continuous visibility into the health and validity of certificates across your infrastructure.

*   Increased visibility into certificate usage patterns provides an understanding of how and where certificates are used in your environment.

*   Proactive threat detection is achieved by comparing validation request patterns to known indicators of compromise or suspicious activities.

### Built-in Business Intelligence

Axon utilizes Amazon QuickSight, a business intelligence service that is fully integrated with the AWS platform. Axon Shield offers a range of built-in analytics dashboards that are readily available, allowing users to assess the accuracy of data in their asset management once connected.
