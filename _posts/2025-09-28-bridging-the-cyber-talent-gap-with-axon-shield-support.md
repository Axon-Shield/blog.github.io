In today’s complex digital landscape, cyber security managers' biggest challenge is to utilise data and tools they already have at their disposal. Your ability to build your team is made extremely difficult by the range of tasks. You need to setup your SaaS and internal tools, understand vendors' language to get the right support and being able to not only analyse but even see the data that is important. Instead of focusing on actual threats and improving your company's security posture, you get bogged down by management of complex and disparate security solutions, monitoring network activities across hybrid environments, and managing the overwhelming volume of security alerts. AXON Shield has been created to address these pain points directly.

Empowering You To Focus On Value-Generating Skills
--------------------------------------------------

You're all too familiar with the situation when you need to hire new talent to cover more topics than is your head count. So not only you face the challenge to find the right person but you are force to define your job descriptions so wide that your chances of getting the right new team member is diminishingly small.

AXON Shield’s Advanced Data Processing
--------------------------------------

One of the key advantages AXON Shield brings to cybersecurity management is its sophisticated technology platform, designed to pull data from a wide array of tools and SaaS services, clean and normalize it, and consolidate it into powerful, actionable datasets. By doing so, AXON Shield enables instant visualization through dashboards, comprehensive reports, and real-time alerts, all tailored to your organization’s specific needs.

### Unified Data Collection and Transformation

AXON Shield integrates with your organization’s cybersecurity toolset, including third-party applications, SaaS solutions, and on-premises tools. By continuously pulling data from these sources, AXON Shield centralizes your security information into a single pipeline. This data is then cleaned and standardized, transforming disparate raw data into cohesive datasets. This unified data allows your team to maintain a complete view of security metrics without being bogged down by fragmented or unstructured information.

### Instant Dashboards, CMDB-Integration, and Real-Time Alerts

The power of AXON Shield’s technology is its ability to deliver instant, actionable insights. With datasets formatted specifically for visualization, AXON Shield generates dashboards that give your team immediate visibility into your security posture. If you wish so, particular asset data can be exported to your internal CMDB system to make it accessible across your enterprise. Real-time alerts allow you to act swiftly on potential threats, while scheduled reports provide a regular summary of trends and risk indicators. Whether it’s an urgent threat alert or a routine health check, AXON Shield’s system ensures that the data is accurate, comprehensive, and accessible when and where you need it.

### Dedicated Public Cloud Environments for Each Customer

Each AXON Shield deployment is implemented within a dedicated public cloud environment specifically created and managed for each customer. This ensures that your data remains securely isolated while benefiting from the scalability and resilience of a cloud-based infrastructure. This setup also allows AXON Shield to apply customer-specific configurations and optimizations, adapting the technology to meet your unique requirements without impacting other customers.

By harnessing AXON Shield’s advanced data integration technology, your organization gains a centralized, real-time view of its cybersecurity landscape. This empowers your team to monitor and respond to threats with unprecedented efficiency, providing an end-to-end solution that’s not only robust but also scalable as your security needs evolve.

Reducing Alert Fatigue
----------------------

You know that one of the biggest challenges your team faces is the sheer volume of security alerts. With AXON Shield’s advanced data processing platform, we transform raw data from across your tools into valuable insights, extracting the most relevant information for your team—whether it’s actual incidents requiring instant response or irregular behavior that you should analyse to understand its triggers, mechanics, root causes..

### Intelligent Data Filtering for Focused Alerting

AXON Shield’s platform uses intelligent algorithms to sift through vast quantities of data, homing in on key data points that indicate potential threats or unusual patterns. This processing takes place between the primary data lake and clean database tables with focused information. This way, your team can understand and focus on the important attributes within a particular problem domain. This allows you to build clear SOPs and runbooks that are not only easy to follow but also suitable for internal training of existing and new members of the team. The system can distinguish between critical security incidents and less pressing irregularities, filtering and ranking alerts based on risk. By receiving only the most relevant information, your team can focus on genuine threats without the distraction of low-priority noise.

### Behavioral Insights to Preempt Threats

AXON Shield also enables your team to detect irregular behavior patterns before they escalate. By analyzing data from various sources across the network, the platform identifies deviations from typical usage patterns, such as unusual login locations, abnormal data transfers, or unexpected access attempts. These insights are flagged as behavioral irregularities, helping your team preemptively respond to potential risks and stay ahead of emerging threats.

AXON Shield doesn't only provide the data but also suggests an initial draft of service processes to maximise use of the data, and its distribution.

### Contextualized Alerts for Faster Incident Response

Each alert generated by AXON Shield comes with contextual information, so your team understands not only the “what” but the “why” behind an alert. By providing background details and recommended actions, AXON Shield empowers your team to make faster, more informed decisions. Instead of spending valuable time analyzing raw data, they’re equipped with the insights needed to respond effectively. This focus on contextualized, actionable information not only speeds up response times but also reduces the risk of overlooking critical issues.

AXON Shield’s data processing platform is built to help your team manage the modern security landscape efficiently. By focusing on key data points, filtering out unnecessary noise, and contextualizing alerts, AXON Shield enables your team to handle incidents proactively, reducing alert fatigue and ensuring that no critical threat goes unnoticed.

DNS - Basis of Network Visibility Across Environments
-----------------------------------------------------

In an increasingly complex network environment, DNS serves as a crucial layer for visibility and control over your organization’s network perimeter. AXON Shield leverages DNS as the backbone of its security platform, providing deep insights into network activity and reinforcing change control across all your networked environments. This DNS-centric approach gives your team unprecedented oversight and helps ensure that security measures remain effective and adaptable as your network evolves.

### DNS as the Core of Network Perimeter Visibility

DNS data reveals vital details about the traffic flowing in and out of your network, enabling your team to detect potential threats and anomalies with greater accuracy. By using DNS as the foundation, AXON Shield consolidates information about your weak points that may be exploitable by external threats. This DNS-based visibility allows your team to prioritise remediations - whether it's WAF protection, or patch management. In some cases, spotting unknown IP addresses or tracking unexpected domain resolutions, AXON Shield’s DNS insights serve as an early warning system for your network.

By centralizing DNS insights within AXON Shield’s platform, you gain a powerful, foundational layer of visibility and control. This approach enhances network monitoring, enforces change control policies, and provides early warnings of suspicious activities, allowing your team to maintain a stronger, more responsive security posture.
