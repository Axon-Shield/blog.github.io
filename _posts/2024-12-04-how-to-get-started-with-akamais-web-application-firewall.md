Ready to Fortify Your Network Perimeter? Here's How to Start with Akamai's WAF
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Obtaining a Web Application Firewall (WAF), Akamai provides this with a powerful tool to improve one of the most secure parts of your web application. The very first days can be handled quite well by simply careful setting and regular checking. How do you put your personal touch in it? What rules would you set up just to soften your operation?

The most critical device you need for network safeguard nowadays is a Web Application Firewall (WAF), a sure way against security threats. We at Akamai and Cloudflare work closely with direct customers and therefore, we have practical experience with both. If I‚Äôm out of time, may I ask if you‚Äôve conquered the first challenge--successfully executed the contract?

Web Application Firewall (WAF) is one of the ways that Akamai protects the network, it can also be set to function it based on a ‚Äúper hostname‚Äù mode and it is mostly for ports 80 and 443. It is different from the IP range-based DDoS protections relying on port 80, 443 and the whole subnet of an ISP‚Äôs own network. When adding a new website to Akamai, focus on the following three aspects:

1.  **HTTPS Certificate** ‚Äì The basis of WAF protection is the secure implementation of the proper certificate.

2.  **Property Creation** ‚Äì Pretend you're the property owner of your digital site within Akamai's setup but you are only the one constructing the site virtually.

3.  **Security Configuration** ‚Äì Build the specifics of the protection to secure your website that is distinguished among other sites.

After following them, you will surely be safe in your digital area. Are you willing to take on this challenge?

### Simplified Steps to Configure Akamai‚Äôs WAF and Secure Your Web Application

To safeguard your web application through Akamai's WAF, you should take the following key measures. Here‚Äôs a clear and practical guide to help you get started:

#### **Step 1: Secure Your HTTPS Certificate**

*   Select the domain names that you require.

*   Download a **CSR file** and set up your certificate.

*   Submit the certificate to Akamai, which stores the private key in one place of the platform where the key is needed.

**Pro Tip**: If your certificate isn‚Äôt ready yet, you can move forward with other setup tasks. The certificate will automatically attach to your configuration once it‚Äôs uploaded.

#### **Step 2: Build Your ‚ÄúProperty‚Äù**

*   **What's a Property**? This represents the content delivery configuration for your site.

*   Start with Akamai's t**emplated Property** and customize it:
    *   Delete unnecessary elements.
    *   For minimal impact during onboarding, remove all caching and monitoring.
    *   Focus on directing traffic to your application that generates responses.

*   Establish an **edge hostname**, which is the significant portion of your DNS update that will connect your traffic to Akamai.

#### **Step 3: Create the Security Configuration**

*   Akamai gives you a **default security template** for you to initiate with.

*   Add the necessary **hostnames and paths** (set paths to /\* to capture all traffic).

*   For initial testing, leave all protections in **"Alert" mode** and deploy the configuration.

### **Testing & Final Adjustments**

1.  **Test on Akamai Staging**
    *   Point your test laptop or VM to Akamai's staging network by editing the hosts file (or equivalent).
    *   Test your website and APIs thoroughly..

2.  **Go Live with DNS Updates**
    *   Point your test laptop or VM to Akamai's staging network by editing the hosts file (or equivalent).
    *   Test your website and APIs thoroughly, or let your customers generate enough traffic.
    *   Relax‚Äîissues are rare unless you have complex mTLS setups.

3.  **Monitor and Fine-Tune**
    *   After 2‚Äì4 weeks, visit **Akamai's Security Centre** to review alerts.
    *   Handle any **false positives** by adding exceptions to your WAF configuration.
    *   Fine-tune **rate limits** for DDoS protection, controlling requests from single IP addresses.

###   
**The Finish Line**

*   Switch your security configuration from "**Alert**" to "**Block**." From this point, Akamai's WAF will actively block XSS, SQLi, and other web attacks.

*   Akamai automatically updates WAF rules for emerging threats. All you need to do is renew your certificate annually.
