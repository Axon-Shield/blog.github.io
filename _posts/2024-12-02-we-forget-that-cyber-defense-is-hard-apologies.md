*We have seen so much that we can instantly see through new vendors' buzzwords.*

What do we see? Years in cyber defense. Systems built. Threats stopped. But what do we miss? The weight of your chaos. The complexity of your day. What is your challenge? To turn scattered tools into a single system. To make sense of your data, align it with priorities. And what do you need? A way to focus. A plan to move forward. What’s the outcome? Chaos transformed into purpose.

### **Myth for Some, Truth for Many**

The perception that cybersecurity is an insurmountable challenge is everywhere.

Fear-driven narratives dominate the conversation. Overwhelming technical jargon makes it feel inaccessible. And the sheer number of tools and threats? It’s daunting.

This leads to paralysis. Decision-making stalls. Businesses feel lost in a maze of complexity, bombarded by warnings of sophisticated attacks and evolving vulnerabilities.

Everyday pressures compound the problem. Systems need maintaining. Alerts keep coming. Tools demand attention. Your team is constantly in reaction mode—fixing issues, resolving tickets, patching holes.

And what suffers?

The strategic work. The long-term planning. The ability to step back, assess the big picture, and make decisions that actually move your security posture forward. The grind of operations eats away at time and focus, leaving little room for proactive defense.

But this narrative is misleading. Cybersecurity doesn’t have to be about doing everything. It’s about doing the right things. With focus, integration, and strategy, it becomes manageable. Not an impossible task—but a necessary and achievable part of protecting your business.

### Our Failure to Appreciate

We’ve been doing cyber defense for so long, it feels second nature. And we keep forgetting. How hard it is to learn new tools. That vendors are sometime sneaky or genuinely oblivious to your big questions.

The complexity of today’s tools. The tangled web of SaaS services. The constant stream of alerts and demands. Once you master it, you forget. It’s overwhelming.

How do you allocate resources when the options are endless, but time and budgets are not? How do you build an operational model for your team when every tool speaks a different language? The challenge isn’t just stopping threats—it’s making sense of the chaos.

And that’s where the real work begins. That's why we started Axon Shield. Aligning your tools. Streamlining your systems. Giving your teams a framework that works, not just another dashboard to manage.

Because without clarity, even the best tools become a burden.

### Your Spending Not Living Up To The Promise

Time after time, the question arises: “Where did the budgets go?” Tools were purchased. Systems were upgraded. Investments were made. Yet, when the next attack hits, the response still falls short.

The tools seemed promising. Each came with a pitch—better defenses, faster alerts, smarter insights. But in practice, they demand constant attention, overlap in functionality, and leave gaps that were never addressed.

On top of everything else, the struggle isn’t just defending against threats—it’s justifying how all that investment still wasn’t enough.

Endless jargon fills vendor presentations—buzzwords that sound important. But rarely survive the end of the presentation. Instead of clarity, you get what vender tells you is "the top priority". You start doubting yourself. They are experts, they must know. So you try to understand their point. Only realising, sometimes too late, that they overpromise on the difference it will make to your life.

Every vendor has a “must-have” solution. Each promises to be the silver bullet. A silver bullet that just works - no work needed. Till your team realises that this new shiny dashboard doesn't really help them with cyber defense. Instead adds another layer to the already bloated tooling stack. Overlapping features, underused capabilities, and rising costs create a cycle of dependency rather than simplification.

In most cases, vendors genuinely believe in their products and the value they add. What they can't understand is that you don't live in a vacuum. That you have been trying to build an efficient threat response process. A process that doesn't get better with random "high criticality" news about hackers, breaches, and losses.

The bottom line is simple. You probably have tools and products. What you need time and energy to create a strategy and efficient processes to use them effectively. And that’s where Axon Shield comes in.

### **Getting Your Rocket Off The Ground**

We don’t build rockets, but we know why they stall. We’ll show you the gaps, help you get it off the ground.

The Axon Shield difference lies in helping you build the strategy and processes. Building processes, rather than systems. Operating frameworks that actually work for your team, rather than making your team work for them. We would take your existing data and collate it. Axon Shield's Fusion Portal is a set of focused, simple and powerful filters. Each of the fusion filters have just one task. It answers just one question you're asking. It implements a thoughtful integration and provides clarity.

Axon Shield's approach is based on efficient use of data lake ingesting APIs and log data from your tools. This data is processed by single-purpose functions, each of them producing information answering one question. This gives you accurate information that you and your teams actually need.

We don’t add noise to an already chaotic environment. Instead, we align your tools, streamline your processes, and focus on what matters most. Think of us as the engineers behind you rocket. Using the resources you already have, fine-tuning them for maximum efficiency. Ensuring everything functions as a cohesive whole. The result? A system that doesn’t just defend against threats, but empowers your team to act decisively. With Axon Shield, your cybersecurity investment isn’t just a cost—it’s a launchpad for success.

We don’t sell cars—we take yours as it stands. We tune it, refine it, put power in your hands.

Your tools, your systems, the resources you own— With Axon Shield, we’ll make them your own.

### Results That Matter

Akamai is one of the largest providers of protection against internet attacks. Denial of service (DoS) attacks. Web application threats like cross-site scripting and SQL injection. Its defenses are broad, robust, and proven.

Logging and reporting are standout features. Millions of alerts generated daily—or even hourly—show just how much Akamai sees. But volume is only the beginning of effective protection.

Using DoS and WAF protections, like those Akamai offers, can be on different levels of maturity.

First, you onboard your applications to the Akamai SaaS platform. A foundational step, but it’s just the start.

Next, rate limits are adjusted. This ensures the system reflects your applications’ needs and prevents genuine traffic from triggering false alarms.

Then comes the shift. Moving from “monitor but let through” to “monitor and block.”  
It’s a critical step—where monitoring becomes true defense.

The final level? Using the data. Attack patterns reveal vulnerabilities.  
Threat trends expose weak points. And understanding your enemies transforms protection into strategy.

Because with the right approach, defense is more than reaction—it’s preparation.a

Axon Shield will help you tune Akamai settings and provide answers to paramount infrastructure questions. How much bandwidth do I need to my web server? What should be the webserver configuration so it withstands residual DoS traffic? How do I do pentesting on servers behind systems like Akamai?

### Simplicity = Effective Response

The foundation of successful cybersecurity rests upon simplicity. By optimizing operating processes organizations reduce spending because they avoid spending extra money on duplicate tools and underutilized features. With a narrower technology scope your team can concentrate on essential matters.

Your team will concentrate on vital tasks while enhancing execution speed because they identify and prioritize essential information against all other data. Network perimeter health tracks through simple dashboards which provide clear visual representations.

The implementation process also sees a significant enhancement because integrated simpler systems operate without interruptions and provide an easier learning experience for your team. Simplicity removes distractions so your resources and efforts precisely fulfill your target objectives. In a world of overcomplicated solutions, simplicity isn’t just efficient—it’s powerful.

Oversensitivity creates the illusion that cybersecurity requires constant frustration. Axon Shield brings order to complexity so your operations remain manageable. We empower your team to focus on what matters. We’ll construct together a system that turns chaos into strategy.

Together, we’ll build a system that works. A system that turns chaos into strategy.
