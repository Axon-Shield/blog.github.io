Most organizations treat DNS as invisible infrastructureâ€”something that just works until it doesn't. But DNS is actually the most powerful lens for understanding your network traffic, user behavior, and security posture. By taking active control of your DNS infrastructure, you unlock unprecedented visibility and control over your internet connectivity.

## DNS: Your Network's Hidden Control Center

### Why DNS is the Perfect Visibility Point
Every internet connection starts with a DNS query, making DNS the universal observation point for:
- **User activity**: Every website visit, app connection, and cloud service access
- **Application behavior**: How your applications discover and connect to services
- **Device communications**: IoT devices, mobile apps, and automated systems
- **Security events**: Malware communications, data exfiltration attempts, and policy violations
- **Performance issues**: Slow or failing service connections

### The DNS Data Goldmine
#### Traffic Patterns
- **Popular destinations**: Which services your organization uses most
- **Usage timing**: When different services are accessed throughout the day
- **Geographic patterns**: Where your traffic is going globally
- **Protocol preferences**: IPv4 vs IPv6 usage patterns
- **Application dependencies**: How different services interconnect

#### User Behavior Insights
- **Work patterns**: Understanding how employees use internet resources
- **Shadow IT discovery**: Finding unauthorized cloud services and applications
