*Walled Garden Transformation into Open Space*

Discover how Axon Shield transforms cybersecurity by breaking free from closed ecosystems. Our technology empowers client autonomy and flexibility, ensuring you only pay for what you need while maintaining control over your SaaS solutions through the Axon Fusion Portal.

### Your Tools, Our Expertise. Keep Control with Axon Fusion Portal

In the cybersecurity sector, companies now impose “walled garden” restrictions on clients which limit them to use only company-provided tools thus blocking them within company systems. As a SaaS tool, Axon Shield's Fusion Portal works from within a client's infrastructure as their public cloud account making SaaS tools separate from cyber defense operations and management. Axon Shield promotes its original cybersecurity approach while enabling seamless addition and deletion of multiple tools and SaaS services to provide clients with top-class data protection at the best market prices.

### We’re Here to Enhance, Not Replace

Axon Shield appreciates all the investments you have made in your cybersecurity systems and tooling. At Axon, we will help you set up your tools, link data to one source, and improve your reports and dashboards whether you are using current tools and services or are looking at new additions. It is our desire to assist you in attaining the minimum level of cybersecurity to establish sound cyber defense operations and incident response.

Axon Fusion Portal acts as the gateway that collects data from your tools into one data store for analysis on Axon’s dashboards or for integration with your internal reporting and inventory systems. You get to control how long your data is kept, the level of sensitivity of different data sets, and you can easily add or remove data sources.

Another of the major problems that cybersecurity teams face is the transition from one tool to another. We know and assist you in handling not only the different format, structure, and content of raw data but, more importantly, the straightforward transition of your operational teams by minimizing changes to the way your cyber teams use and analyze the information.

As a small to medium-sized enterprise, e-commerce platform, or developing technology firm, Axon Fusion Portal allows you to control your monitoring and response data without straining your budget. We aim to enhance, not replace. So, with Axon Shield, we provide a method to optimize current tool usage instead of discarding them.

Only large enterprises are currently able to spend enough to integrate incident response with incident management systems. Axon Fusion Portal aims to provide a better level of control over monitoring and more efficient cyber defense response for less spend. This would make agile cyber defense accessible to small and medium enterprises. . Our approach is to use your existing tools and maximise their value. At the same time, to allow you to build your team around your strategy rather than to learn the tooling.

### Security on Your Terms

At Axon Shield, we offer 'Security on Your Terms' cybersecurity that is flexible, personalized and aligned to your business needs and unique requirements. Our approach turns the basics of cybersecurity from a static process dependent only on third-party software into a dynamic and individualized approach, allowing you to define both the focus of your organization’s cyber protection and the type of actionable insights and technology integration you want to see in your SOC or incident management.

Axon Shield allows organizations to take charge of their security strategies and incorporate them into their daily operations. This integrated approach shifts security from a traditional defensive tool to an essential component that drives business success. At Axon Shield, we transform cybersecurity from a necessary compliance requirement into a strategic business tool that helps companies thrive in an ever-changing digital environment.

### **Axon Fusion Portal**

Our technology centers around the Axon Fusion Portal, a public cloud account that we use to deploy the following key elements that are customised to needs of each customer:

1.  A set of essential automation and infrastructure tools that provide automatic updates, patching and maintenance as well as strong security for databases and data access.
    
2.  Tailored serverless data collection components, configured based on your preferred tools. These tools are foundational and include DNS integration as a critical data source for protecting your assets: There are no virtual servers required for the Axon Fusion Portal's functionality.
    
3.  Components for deterministic data processing that merges information in a systematic way to produce refined datasets to support efficient targeted reports and dashboards.
    
4.  AI powered data analytics providing a different view / visibility of anomalies (i.e., potentially malicious actions) in data sets.
    
5.  Modules for data export that securely place cleansed data into your internal systems with ease. One common application is the integration with ServiceNow.
    

All of these technological elements are housed in a cloud account that you are completely responsible for and in control of. You are also able to create your own processing capabilities as long as you comply with the Axon Fusion Portal rules which ensure that the use of Axon’s technology is efficient.

Axon Shield is not something you should look for if you are looking for a new SaaS tool to gather new data to make parts of your infrastructure that were invisible. Axon Shield is something to consider if you want to get the most out of your current data, to build a single pane of glass and give your teams data that is relevant to your strategy.
